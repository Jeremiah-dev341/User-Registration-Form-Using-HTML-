# User Registration Form

## Project Description
This project is a **User Registration Form** built with **HTML5**.  
It demonstrates the use of **semantic HTML elements** such as `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`, and `<footer>` while implementing a fully functional form with multiple input types.

No CSS or JavaScript is used â€” the focus is only on **HTML structure, form inputs, and accessibility**.
